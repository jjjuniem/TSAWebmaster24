                   Solar Panels can range from $18,000 to $36,000. This depends on where you live and if there is a tax rebate (you learn about this in the tax rebate section).

                <dd>
                    Geothermal Heat Pumps do not have a cost per watt because they can get expensive. Installation and the pump costs anywhere from $15,000-40,000.

                    "In 2022, hydroelectricity systems had an average installation cost of 2,881 U.S. dollars per kilowatt installed."
Hydropower is one of the most efficient ways to generate electricity. Modern hydro turbines can convert as much as 90% of the available energy into electricity which is significantly greater than most other forms of energy.
