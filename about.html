        <br>
        <dt>Who We Are</dt>
        <dd> We are four high school students who believe in a better, greener plant. Anyone can find ways to make the earth cleaner, especially homeowners.</dd>
        <br>
        <dt>What We Believe</dt>
        <dd> We believe in helping others grow and learn about even the slightest impact of changing our world for the better. We strive to help others learn so that we can ultimately save our planet! The world needs to change in order for anyone to have a future. We do not need to change everything about what we do, just how we do it. There are already so many options for renewable energy and although there are cons to each option, currently they are the best way for us to begin helping the earth. In time these options will improve more and more. We believe that this is not only an investment in saving money and helping the earth long term but also an investment in our future generation long term. We must be the change we seek in the world -Gandhi </dd>
