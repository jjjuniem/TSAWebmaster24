               Geothermal Energy is vitalizing the heat within the heart. Power plants are the primary source of geothermal energy. One of the most significant benefits of this energy is the fact that it is renewable. Renewable means the resource cannot be used up if the mining rate is kept lower than the repletion rate. Unlike wind or solar energy, geothermal is continuous, meaning that it is always constant. Geothermal is not 100% the best due to some problems. Location can be a significant aspect in whether or not it will work well. Geothermal energy can contribute significantly to forming energy in areas like Hawaii, with volcanos. However, it wouldnâ€™t make sense financially in areas not close to volcanos or lots of activity. Geothermal Energy costs anywhere from $40 to $80 per megawatt-hour (MWh).
